# Laura Sierra's Portfolio

## Description

To showcase my growth as a web developer for myself and employers, I have created this portoflio of the work I have done and will be doing. This portfolio, in itself, will improve and see changes in its technologies used and designs as I learn new skills in my current coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, and Git

## Future implementations

For a better user experience, I will improve the semantics and viewport responsiveness.
